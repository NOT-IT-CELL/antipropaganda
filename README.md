# antipropaganda
We are the Not IT Cell. A volunteer effort to counter the richly funded [propaganda machinery](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/09/26/hindu-nationalist-social-media-hate-campaign) (also called the IT Cell) of the current Indian regime. This counter will be in the form of verifiable facts, not deceptive "dark pattern" propaganda tactics deployed by authoritarian regimes worldwide, including the current Indian regime. If you want to contribute, you can submit a PR  (requires some knowledge of using git/github) or just open an issue (can be easily done right on this site. Look for the "Issues" tab above).
